INFO

MarkLogic Whiteboard is a real-time text and image whiteboard that is
infinitely scrollable. You can drag and drop images from your desktop to the
browser and have them appear immediately. These pictures will be seen by all
viewing the same whiteboard page. The pictures can then be dragged infinitely
around the page and this will display in real-time to others.

Text can be put on the page by double clicking on a blank spot in the page and
then beginning to type. Text can be modified by double clicking on the text
again.

MarkLogic Whiteboard allows you to create your own whiteboards and search
on the content of each whiteboard. In order to create your own whiteboard just
add some letters to the end of the url.

Ex: http://localhost:8011/test

This project was inspired by www.yourworldoftext.com.
